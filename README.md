# SNAKE BRAIN

### How to run
Open the index.html in chrome.  
Press start to start the game.  
Any time you change your snake, you will need to reload the page!  

## Challenge #1

1. Currently the snake will only move to the left.  
2. Can you try make the snake move down?  
⋅⋅* Can you make the snake move up?  
⋅⋅* Can you make the snake move to the right?  
3. Why can the snake not move to the right?  



## Challenge #2

At the moment the snake is not very smart.  
He will be a very hungry snake if he does not become smarter!  
To make our snake **smarter** we will need to add questions to our snake brain.  
  
In programming we ask the computer questions with the word **if**!  
Here is an example you might ask every day.  
  
if (today_is_a_school_day()) {  
	go_to_school()  
}  
else {  
	enjoy_the_weekend()  
}  
  
Just like you would ask if today is a school day, your snake will want to know where the apple is!  
Here is an example of the snake checking if the apple is above or below it's head.  
  
if (apple_is_above()) {  
	move_???()  
}  
else {  
	move_down()  
}  
  
1. What would you replace the **???** with in this last example?
2. Make the change and copy this code into your snake brain!
3. What happens, does your snake get the apple?
4. The only way the snake can get the apple, is if it becomes **smarter**!

## Challenge #3

So we know that we can check to see if the apple is above, but what if we want to check if the apple is in another direction?  
For this we will need to have more questions for our snake brain!  
In this following example, we will ask more questions about our week.  

if (today_is_a_school_day()) {  
	go_to_school()  
}  
else if (today_is_Saturday()) {  
	go_to_sport()  
}  
else {  
	go_to_the_beach()  
}  

In the example above, if the day was Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday, you would go to school.  
If it was not any of those days, and if it was Saturday, then you would go to sport.  
And if it was not any of those school days and it was not Saturday, you would go to the beach!  

We can do the same thing with our snake brain!  

if (apple_is_above()) {  
	move_???()  
}  
else if (apple_is_below()) {  
	move_???()  
}  
else if (apple_is_left()) {  
	move_???()  
}  
else {  
	move_???()  
}  

1. Update the missing ??? commands and then put this in the snake brain.
2. Is your snake hungry now?
3. How long can the snake get before he runs into a problem?
